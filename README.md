# Homebrew tap for GitHub CLI

First-time:

```sh
brew install github/homebrew-gh/gh
```

That's it. You are now ready to use `gh`. ðŸ¥³

```console
$ gh help
Do things with GitHub from your terminal

Usage:
  gh [flags]
  gh [command]

Available Commands:
  help        Help about any command
  pr          Work with pull requests
```

To stay up to date with `gh` development:

```sh
brew upgrade gh
```

Thank you for testing GitHub CLI! ðŸŒŸ
